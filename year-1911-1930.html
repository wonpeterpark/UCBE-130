                                <p><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;I</strong>n 1912, the university came under intense pressure from the people of southern California 
                                    to createa new, rival institution. To answer the calls, but without wanting to concede to creating a newuniversity all together, 
                                    the university’s president, Benjamin Ide Wheeler recruited Ira WoodsHowerth from the University of Chicago to create a strong 
                                    Extension presence in the southern partsof the state. It turned out that Howerth was even more of an idealist than Stephens and 
                                    openlystated his vision for Extension to serve the people of the state in the ways they wanted and neededto be served, 
                                    irrespective of University ideals. To achieve this objective, he designed a trailblazingorganizational structure and implemented 
                                    visionary new departments: Beyond the original classinstruction, he revived the popular public lectures and added entertainment 
                                    to them, he createddepartments for debate and public discussion as well as information and social welfare. To reacheven more 
                                    people, he pioneered correspondence instruction and allocated an entire department toit which served up to 5,500 students in 1917. 
                                    Extension also began working with other institutions inoffering classes to specific audiences whose need for education was 
                                    particularly telling-for instance,the inmates at San Quentin and Folsom prisons. In 1915, Extension ventured into new forms 
                                    of education and set up the Department of Visual Instruction to exploit the new motion picturetechnology for educational purposes. 
                                    Howerth was an idealistic visionary clearly ahead of his time,and as such the university implemented regulatory bodies that govern 
                                    Extension until today,including the Academic Senate Committees on Extension (1912) and Courses of Instruction (1913). In1917 Extension 
                                    began offering courses in Los Angeles a full two years before the university finallygave in to the calls of the public and in 
                                    1917 established its second campus, UCLA. By the timeHowerth was let go from the university while serving in World War I in 1918, 
                                    he had managed toestablish Extension as the fundamental institution and model of the higher and continuingeducation it is today in 
                                    California and around the world. At the end of the first world war, Californiaexperienced an economic boom accompanied by a dramatic 
                                    increase of population, which meantthat suddenly there was a greater need, and more money available, for education to offer its 
                                    basicac ademic curriculum, Extension began providing vocational and training courses to thousands ofveterans and to others eager to 
                                    compete in new industrial markets.</p>

                                <p><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;I</strong>n the 1920s, Professor Leon Richardson served as Director of Extension and reintroduced 
                                    the idealsof Liberal Arts education into the educational standards and offerings, and recruited standardfaculty again. 
                                    His humanistic vision for Extension was that of ‘lifelong learning’, a term for which iswidely credited, and which made 
                                    Extension a national model and him a leading figure in ContinuingEducation.  In 1923, in collaboration with the American 
                                    Federation of Labor, Extension launched theWorkers' Education Bureau of America, which offered courses in economics, public 
                                    speaking, andlabor problems and history. Despite the fact that many faculty were reluctant to lecture to ordinaryadult 
                                    learners, notably in mission-driven programs targeted at workers, Extension grew rapidly andby 1924, ranked second in the 
                                    country in the number of continuing edu​cation courses offered by aninstitution of higher education..<p>
