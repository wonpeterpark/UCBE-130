                            <p><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;F</strong>ollowing years of calls from the public to open access to Berkeley’s excellent courses and 
                                programs, University Extension came to life in 1891 when three professors crossed the Bay 
                                by ferry to offer courses in San Francisco in history (Prof. Bacon), 
                                mathematics (Prof. Stringham) and Englishliterature (Prof. Gayley)​2​. 
                                These long awaited education opportunities were met with much enthusiasm by the people of 
                                San Francisco, more than 800 people attended the first classes. 
                                However, following the official approval of Extension by the Academic Senate in 1892, 
                                a financial crisis hit the university and in 1893 the faculty was no longer able to provide courses 
                                to the public without being offered any compensation</p>

                            <p><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;I</strong>n 1902, the Board of Regents made University Extension an autonomous department under the
                                leadership of the former Cornell history professor Henry Morse Stephens. Stephens was a fervent
                                supporter of the original ideology of university extension’s: “I am longing to try my hand on a great
                                Extension scheme on the Oxford line - I know I can do it and make a success of it.” In contrast to the
                                initial ‘free lectures’ model of Gayley and his colleagues, Stephens designed and organized lecturesto meet the needs and interests of adult professionals across the state. This model was operating
                                largely independently of the Academic Senate, used mainly non-faculty lecturers offering non-credit
                                courses, and was self-funded through a subscription model. With this extremely agile and
                                student-centric model, he created the fundamental concept of Continuing Education as we know it
                                today. The success of this model and his own energy, engagement and popularity, allowed
                                corresExtension to grow exponentially, reaching its peak of 15 centers around the state of California
                                in 1905. However, when Stephens continued his career with other university appointments after
                                1905, Extension activities declined until they ultimately ceased in 1910.<p>
