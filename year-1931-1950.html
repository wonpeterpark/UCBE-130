                                <p><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;T</strong>he Great Depression impacted Extension’s ability to maintain its 
                                    educational offerings, nevertheless, new structural changes allowed for the creation of new resources for 
                                    professional career development. While other universities across the country spun out their Extensions 
                                    to become independent colleges with their own standards, faculty and programs, UC held on to its original 
                                    design of an integrated Extension. As a consequence, control of the Academic Senate grewand to ensure the 
                                    continuing ability to deliver university credit bearing courses, while providing professional training, 
                                    Extension offerings were divided into three categories: degree credit, professional upgrading, and noncredit 
                                    offerings.</p>

                                <p><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;D</strong>uring World War II, Extension classes and correspondence courses 
                                     became an important way forservice personnel to continue their education. As part of the war effort, 
                                    Extension’s Director Professor Baldwin Munger Woods took over the Engineering Science Management Defense 
                                    Training(ESMDT) Program. By the end of the war, hundreds of thousands of research dollars poured 
                                    into California, spawn​ing new industries and, once again, dramatically increasing the population. 
                                    UCLA Extension met the critical need for retraining mandated by Southern California's burgeoning aerospace 
                                    industry, while UC Berkeley Extension expanded its business and engineering course sacross the state. 
                                    Growth also meant an increased demand for teachers. Extension responded by developing an emergency teacher 
                                    training program that enabled new teachers to satisfy the state's credential requirements. With the new UC Santa 
                                    Barbara campus, a new Extension began offering classes in 1944. All thewhile, important new programs were 
                                    developed and implemented. Continuing Education of the Bar(CEB), for example, was established in 1947 by the 
                                    Regents of the University and the State Bar of California. Today it is one of the country's largest continuing 
                                    education programs for lawyers.<p>
